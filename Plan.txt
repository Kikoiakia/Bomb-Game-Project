Food Store Project:


A basic food store chain has requested you to make an app so it can run it's business smoothly
without the need of a lot of human hand.
Your goal is simple. Make an app that has a database and keep track of what is inside the store.

You will have methods for:
-buying a product 
-selling a product
-updating an existing product
-adding a new product
-checking all available stock

You can make it either a console app or an online app.

Side project:
	-If it's an online app it has options of buying products online and getting them delivered to an address.
